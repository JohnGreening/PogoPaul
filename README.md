A long long time ago, I met and used to watch a chap called Paul Barker program away on our schools BBC model B. I couldn't program in assembler at the time and was fascinated with the little games he would create.

I left school and we didn't keep in touch and so I never learnt that he actually got a game published!  It was called "Pogo Pete", link below, grab a Beeb emulator and give it a go if you like.

Anyway since retiring I've taught myself assembler on the ZX Spectrum, my micro of the day and managed to bag myself a Spectrum Next from the second Kickstarter and have slogged my way through learning that. 

The result is "Pogo Paul", a homage to Paul's work but with my own slant.

Written entirely in Spectrum Next Z80 on the excellent ODIN assembler/compiler. Thanks Matt Davies !

Thanks to all those that have answered my daft questions on here and other forums and who have provided tutorials and the like. I would have given up ages ago without this help.

A work in progress, more features to come. Constructive feedback welcome but I'm not an expert by anymeans some of my code is awful but it seems to works.
